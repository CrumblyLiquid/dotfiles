# Tofi

Very fast and simple application launcher.
Nothing like the bloated and frankly unusable
Windows launcher.

There isn't much to configure but it does everything I
want :)

## Packages

- [`tofi`](https://github.com/philj56/tofi)

## Configuration

Tofi uses the basic `ini` format
and the actual configuration is just a bunch of key-value pairs.

The default configuration file is described here:
https://github.com/philj56/tofi/blob/master/doc/config

There's also a configuration manpage available via `man 5 tofi`
or here:
https://github.com/philj56/tofi/blob/master/doc/tofi.5.md

## Location

All of the configuration locations are described
in `man tofi` or here: https://github.com/philj56/tofi/blob/master/doc/tofi.1.md#files

The default configuration path is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tofi/config`
