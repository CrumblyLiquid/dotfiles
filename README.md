# Crumbly's Dotfiles
Here are most of my important dotfiles.

## Installation
I'm using [toml-bombadil](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil)
for dotfiles management.

First install 'toml-bombadil' then clone this repository and navigate into it.
To install the dotfiles run 'bombadil install .' and 'bombadil link'
